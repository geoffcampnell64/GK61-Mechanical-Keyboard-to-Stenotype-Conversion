## Mechanical Keyboard to Stenotype Conversion

I've been interested in trying my hand(s) at stenography or a number of years, but the price point for keyboards like the EZ Plank, the Georgi, or the Gherkin were just out range of what what I was willing to pay. I have a tendancy to over-commit monitarily when starting a new hobby, and I didn't want to do that with this project.

But after digging a bit I realized that I could convert a mechanical keyboard into a half decent stenotype without sacraficing too much quality. 

### Keyboard Selection

I ended up purchacing the [GK61 Mechanical Gaming Keyboard](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07QYHPCHD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) from amazon.ca for $65.99 (CAD).

I used the following selection criteria to narrow down my choices:

- Must have NKRO
- Must have linear low weight switches
- Small form factor

After a couple of hours of hunting I found the GK61. It has full NKRO, Gateron optical red switches, and was a 60%. A bonus was that the Gateron optical switches are hot-swappable so I can remove all but the ones I'll be using.
